Since I started my career I have been a Frontend developer and did some full stack internships, I kept asking myself how things are deployed to the internet, how companies build their infrastructures and so on. So as a curious person I wanted to learn more about this subject so i started learning about the cloud and especially AWS.

## My First Experience with AWS

After finishing my first full stack project, a [rating website](https://github.com/joesabbagh1/rating-app), I wanted to host it including the backend and the database. I had little knowledge about the cloud and infrastructure in general, so I started researching how to deploy a full stack app to AWS, I had previous experience in docker so I chose to deploy the app on ECS. Thinking about it now, that was a terrible idea for a beginner but I tried my best and managed to deploy the app but it kept crashing and I had no idea why. 

I wanted to know why nothing was working and what's happening behind the scenes, that's when I started learning about AWS. Luckily [Forward MENA](https://forwardmena.org/) granted me access to their newly lanched platform back then, [Namiskills](https://nammiskills.org/), which offered a variety of courses about AWS, cloud, devops, ect. So I started studying and enrolled in the **AWS Certified Developer - Associate** learning path.


## AWS Certified Developer - Associate

Studying for the Developer exam wasn't easy, I was getting introduced to a lot of new services and concepts, and trying to balance studying and work was a bit challenging at times. I finished the [Namiskills](https://nammiskills.org/) learning path, then I took [Stephane Maarek's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/) which was really helpful and prepared for the exam the most. I then practiced the exam using [Tutoriol Dojo](https://tutorialsdojo.com/) a lot.

After all of that, which took nearly 3 months, I finally took the exam, and finished it in less than 1 hour and passed! The reason I finished it in less than 1 hour is because my laptop ran out of battery and I didn't have my charger, but luckily I had solved most of the questions and that was enough.


## AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional

After passing the Developer exam, I immediatly set passing the DevOps exam in the next months as a goal. After reading about the exam and looking through the material, I noticed how hard it is compared to the Developer exam. If the Developer exam was 3/10 difficulty, the DevOps one was 10/10. Especially if you had no professional experience like me. 

Even tho I doubted myself at first, I still believed with enough preperation I can pass it. just like the Developer exam, I completed the learning path on [Namiskills](https://nammiskills.org/) then took [Stephane Maarek's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional-hands-on/), tho I loved Stephane Dev course, I didn't like his DevOps one. He wasn't getting into the nitty gritty of the services and felt he was just reading the presentation out loud with no further explanation. So I decided to take [Adrian Cantrill's course](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional) which I really enjoyed. He was explaining everything in detail and giving hands on examples that were clear and detailed, 10/10 would recommend. And finally I practiced the exam on [Tutoriol Dojo](https://tutorialsdojo.com/).

After a couple months, I took the exam, which lasted for 3 hours and was exhausting, as you can't leave your chair or eat. I felt okay after it, not sure if I'm gonna pass so I waited couple days for the results. The worst thing happened and I failed on 1 question, I scored 739/1000 which was short 11 points from passing, the exam has 65 scored questions. I was really devastated, but I bottled up my feelings and started preparing again to take the exam again as soon as possible. 

I prepared more for my second try, took more notes, read more the official AWS Docs, ect. So after my second attempt, I passed the exam finally with 808/1000! I was so relieved as I was afraid I'm gonna fail again and wasn't sure if I was willing to take the exam for the 3rd time.

## How I got the exams for free

[Forward MENA](https://forwardmena.org/) were the reason I got the certifications, they provided me with the first steps to start my journey, gave me the exams for free, even after I failed the DevOps exam, they gave another voucher for the second try. I truly thank them. 

## Mistakes I made while preparing for the exams

The biggest mistake I made was not taking enough notes about each service and each detail, if you are planning on completing a certification please take notes, it will help you a lot in the future. 

I learned from my mistakes tho, and now while studying for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam, I'm documenting everything and taking notes of all the details, here's how my notes are looking till now.

I'm using [Obsedian App](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes. I really recommend the app, and here's a [video](https://youtu.be/oxUVn37-Igk?si=mM51mMo3dxohDIe7) that explains how to set up an effective note-taking system.

## Next steps

As I mentioned before, I'm studying for the Kubernetes Application Developer exam, I'm planning to complete all the kubernetes exam in the upcoming 6 months and become a [Kubestronaut](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/resources/kubestronaut-program/#:~:text=The%20Kubestronaut%20Program%20recognizes%20community,an%20exclusive%20jacket%20and%20more), and after that complete the Azure DevOps path.
