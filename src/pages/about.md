I’m a software engineer with a diverse skill set in DevOps, Cloud Computing, and Front-End Development. Lately, I’ve been focusing on mastering Kubernetes, setting up a homelab, and deepening my knowledge of cloud technologies. After completing the AWS Developer (Associate) and DevOps Engineer (Professional) certifications, I’m now working toward the CKAD.

This blog serves as a space to document my learning journey, tackle challenges, and share practical insights—from the best Vim tricks I’ve picked up to how I organize my notes more efficiently.
